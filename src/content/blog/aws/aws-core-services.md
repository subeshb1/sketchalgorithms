**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. **Compute** refers to server resources that are being used. It can be used to make Application servers, Game servers, Database servers and so on. **Cloud** refers to the servers being hosted in the clouds and **Elastic** refers to the ability to increase or decrease amount of service and resource required by the server automatically using the configured settings. Instead of servers they are called **Amazon EC2 instances**. Some of the benefits of an EC2 instance over traditional servers can be listed as:

- **Pay as you go** - You only have to pay when the instance is running.
- **Broad selection of HW/SW** - Amazon provides a wide range of selection for hardware and software specs. You can choose from variety of OS and configure memory, storage and so on according to your need.
- **Auto Scaling** - The ability to increase or decrease the compute power of an instance depending upon the need.
- **Extremely reliable and secure.**
