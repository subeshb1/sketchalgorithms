**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

 **Compute** refers to server resources that are being used. It can be used to make Application servers, Game servers, Database servers and so on. **Cloud** refers to the servers being hosted in the clouds and **Elastic** refers to the ability to increase or decrease the amount of service and resource required by the server automatically using the configured settings.

Instead of servers, they are called **Amazon EC2 instances**. Some of the benefits of an EC2 instance over traditional servers can be listed as:

- **Pay as you go** - You only have to pay when the instance is running.
- **Broad selection of HW/SW** - Amazon provides a wide range of selection for hardware and software specs. You can choose from a variety of OS and configure memory, storage and so on according to your needs.
- **Global Hosting** - An EC2 instances can be hosted in any regions provided by Amazon that span across the world.
- **Auto Scaling** - The ability to increase or decrease the compute power of an instance depending upon the need.
- **Extremely reliable and secure**.

You can view all the EC2 features in [Amazon EC2 features](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/features/). To create your first EC2 instance checkout [Creating and EC2 Instance](/aws/creating-an-ec2-instance).
