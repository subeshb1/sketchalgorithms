With the enormous growth, global reach and increasing complexity of the web it opens a door for attackers to exploit and destroy web applications. There are a lot of ways that a web application can be exposed to vulnerabilities. But there are common security vulnerabilities that tend to occur frequently in most of the web applications and can easily be exploited. This is where OWASP comes into play.

> OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a not-for-profit group that helps organizations develop, purchase, and maintain software applications that can be trusted.

OWASP listed out **Top 10 Web Application Security Risks** which was last updated in 2017 which contain flaws so prevalent and severe that no web application should be delivered to customers without some evidence that the software does not contain these errors.

This series will cover all the 10 Security Risks on how and why they occur along with their mitigation. In this article the 10 risks will be briefly discussed and later in in the series will be discussed in detail.
